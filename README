Booting on Beaglebooard:
  0. Connect to board via serial.
  1. Interrupt U-boot boot sequence.
  2. Run 'loady' on the U-boot command-line and use minicom to transfer
     kernel.bin to the board.
  3. Run 'go 0x80200000' on the U-boot command-line to boot.

In order for minicom to send the boot binary over serial, install the linux
package lrzsz.
